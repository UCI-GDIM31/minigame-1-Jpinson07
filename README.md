## Devlog
Components are the behavior of game objects while game objects are the fundamentals of the scene. These three have a relationship where they can't function without each other. But together they are the fundamentals of what a game is and how to create a game. Without these three working hand and hand with each other no game would ever be able to be created and be able to be played. A mutualistic relationship is the foundation of what a game is built upon and manipulating these three different functions is how I got my game to run so well and be fun but challenging to play.
